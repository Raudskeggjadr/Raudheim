My name is Zygmunt Mocek but it is often shortened to Sig.
At 28 I finally decided what path I want to take in my life, and that path had to do with coding.
Coding gives me genuine pleasure and learning and especially testing new things can be fun.
Programing is a carrer path that I would like to take for my future, maybe even for the rest of my life.
Thank you for visiting and checking out my code. happy coding and see you out there!
